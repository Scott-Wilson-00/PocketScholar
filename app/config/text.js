    whatIsPs:
      "PocketScholar is a volunteer project geared towards students to spark thoughts about how they’ll fund their post-secondary education and set themselves up for a successful future. Making yourself a successful candidate for scholarships is by far the most time effective way to finance yourself and develop crucial skills in the process. By getting a head start and making a sensible investment of time and effort, you can kickstart your financial future to lead a more generous, ambitious, and vibrant life!\n\n" +
      "PocketScholar isn’t a tool to help you find scholarships, nor is it a guide on how to successfully apply for them; there are already plenty of those to choose from! What it can be, however, is a catalyst for exceptional growth in many areas of your life. To successfully utilize PocketScholar, you are encouraged to do the thinking and the work that comes with it, because I don’t hope to help you win scholarships, I want you to become <i>the type of person</i> who wins scholarships!\n\n" +
      "While scholarship awards may be your inspiration for picking up PocketScholar, money or not, you have the capacity to be a better person by reflecting and acting upon what this app has to offer. By outlining the blueprint for success, shifting your perspective, and posing questions that will force you to think about what lies ahead, PocketScholar will help you lay the path to prosperity far beyond solely winning scholarships. Now the only question is, will you follow it?\n\n",
    whyDoesPsExist:
      "The drive behind PocketScholar’s development is multifaceted, though the primary motivation stems from two main sources.\n\n" +
      "I entered high school as a respectable, but not quite outstanding student. I had always been studious when it came to academics, and also took my athletics and arts very seriously. I felt successful, my parents never complained about my grades, nor my teachers about my behaviour, yet by personal preference I remained confined to the ecosystem that I had slowly formed throughout childhood, slowing my personal growth in the process. I wish I had PocketScholar so I could have changed that earlier!\n\n" +
      "Completing my homework in a timely manner and spending hours at sports practices and games, I felt as if I was busy every day of the week. In reality I was cheating myself. Despite my perceived busyness, I still had ample free time which I chose to exhaust with activities that provided little else but entertainment. While the time you enjoy wasting isn’t truly wasted, you will discover that there are much better alternatives that can give you the best of both worlds.\n\n" +
      "For me, grades nine and ten seemed to pass far too quickly. At the end of the two short years, I came to the realization that by sticking to the familiar, I had missed out on an amazing window of opportunity to explore what else life has to offer. While I still had many stimulants for growth during those early highschool years, I now frequently look back and remind myself that with the limited time you have, simply being comfortable is a luxury. You should strive for nothing less than excellence.\n\n" +
      "Through my personal experiences, I hope to ensure that once having interacted with PocketScholar, you will take the opportunity to use your time more effectively, further engage with your community, begin to learn valuable new skills, take more initiative, and seek to be a leader.\n\n",
    whyDoesPsExist2:
      "Post-secondary education can be an incredible time of growth and self-discovery, but for many students, it comes at a significant cost. According to Statistics Canada, between 2000 and 2015, one in two post-secondary graduates had student debt at graduation, with this trend holding firm in recent years.\n\n" +
      "The ‘Student Debt Crisis’ is a familiar phrase for the majority of Canadians, but many don’t recognize the weight that it carries. Fewer still, are the students like you and I that understand how student debt could influence the way we live our lives in the future.\n\n" +
      "There is an alarming amount of students who graduate <i>tens of thousands of dollars</i> in student debt, which can take years to repay. Moreover, it is reported that in Canada during 2018, student debt contributed to about 18% of insolvencies (people not being able to pay their debts on time). The average student debtor was 35 years old and still had almost $15,000 in student debt, making up over 30% of their debt to repay!\n\n" +
      "By holding debt for an extended period of time as a young adult, you rob yourself of one of your greatest wealth-building tools: <i>compound interest.</i> To learn more about the powers of compound interest, visit the Resources page of PocketScholar.\n\n" +
      "When you’re debt-free and you wield your own financial freedom, the world will present you with endless opportunities. An oppressive weight lifted off your shoulders, being in control of your financial health opens you up to many possibilities for generosity, risk-taking, creativity, and ultimately, fulfillment.\n\n" +
      "Winning scholarships is clearly not the only way to help finance your education, but it is definitely the most time effective way to do so. Additionally, instilling yourself with the values of a scholarship winner will carry through into your personal relationships, career, and beyond. After stirring up the ideas to give yourself a running start, you’ll be on track to leading the life you want to live, while uplifting others along the way.\n\n",
    psInfoPages:
      "PocketScholar’s three information pages offer the bulk of lessons that my research and  experiences have to offer. Each page provides relevant discourse on how to become the best you that you can be!\n\n" +
      "While they are solely text, the information pages are for anything but passive reading. Instead, you’re encouraged to engage with the written content. Start by asking (but don’t limit yourself to) the following questions about what you read during and after every section:\n\n" +
      "- Do I understand what’s being said? If so, do I agree with it? Why or why not?\n\n" +
      "- Am I practicing what I agree with? If not, what’s stopping me? (Answer: probably nothing!)\n\n" +
      "- What can I do to better apply the principles that I’ve discovered?\n\n" +
      "By participating in this manner, you’re much more likely to spark something within yourself that will drive you forward while working towards your aspirations. If you feel like you don't have particular aspirations yet, don’t worry, you’ll have a better time finding them with PocketScholar at your side!\n\n" +
      "Additional thought provoking questions will turn up throughout each section. Take your time to answer them first by yourself, then with others as well. Answering the questions above is a great first step, but they mean nothing if your behaviour doesn’t change. Get out there and use your newfound knowledge to make yourself extraordinary!\n\n",
    aboutPage:
      "The About page is your one-stop shop on learning how to use PocketScholar to its maximum potential. It contains the background information on why you should take control of your future now, and it also gives you the tools for learning how to do so!\n\n",
    getStartedPage:
      "It will take lots of time and energy, but the quest for improvement is definitely worth it. The Get Started page ensures that your time and energy is well spent and that you’re rewarded for your efforts.\n\n" +
      "However, your rewards will not only come in the form of scholarships. When you grow as a result of your work, you’ll find that you gain confidence, meaningful relationships, and useful skills. You will have likely helped others along the way, and demonstrated excellence or innovation in fields of your interest. You’ll know you have grown as a person, and you won't need to win any scholarships to validate that fact!\n\n" +
      "The Get Started page will outline steps to take as you navigate your environment. There are no one-size-fits-all guidelines that can be provided to guarantee your progress, but with the help of versatile advice, learning from others’ experiences, and some active self-reflection, you are entirely capable of producing a personalized plan of action that will work for you.\n\n",
    challengesPage:
      "There are plenty of challenges that you may run into when you are striving to be your best, so contrary to how it may appear, the Challenges page isn’t there to give you more. In fact, it will highlight some of the toughest hurdles you might encounter and offer methods which you can take advantage of to overcome them!\n\n",
    psInteractable:
      "It wouldn’t be an app without some more things to press! PocketScholar’s interactable pages offer space to lay out all your thoughts and experiences in one convenient place.\n\n" +
      "Take the time to review what you have accomplished and where to head next. Stepping back to take a look at the big picture is an indispensable habit that you should form as soon as possible, the more you do it, the more you notice how much doing so helps!\n\n" +
      "Coming back to PocketScholar will remind you of how far you’ve progressed and energize you for what’s to come. As you get more involved, scout out scholarships, or learn something new about yourself, you have a place to instantly record it. Just reach for your pocket!\n\n",
    activityList:
      "The Activity List will help you keep track and quantify all of the activities that you partake in, whether they are for leisure, hobbies, clubs, sports, councils, competitions, volunteer initiatives, internships, jobs, you name it!\n\n" +
      "<b>Fields:</b>\n" +
      "<i>Name:</i> The name of the activity you participated in or the organization it belonged to (eg: Greenpeace Canada)\n\n" +
      "<i>Period of Involvement:</i> The date at which you began the activity and the date you ended * or whether the activity is ongoing* (eg: April 2019 - February 2021)\n\n" +
      "<i>Commitment:</i> The amount of time you commit to the activity, measured in either hours/week or hours/month (eg: 2h/week)\n\n" +
      "<i>Key Roles/Responsibilities:</i> What are you responsible for in the activity and how does that impact others? (eg: Event Coordinator: organized a food drive for homeless shelters in order to reduce the environmental impact of food waste)\n\n" +
      "<i>Awards / Achievements:</i> What have you accomplished in your role? Have you won any awards? Think of what that says about your character. (eg: Initiated over 400 contributions to food drives, eliminating over 60kg of food wastage)\n\n" +
      "By keeping a record of your involvement with your community, there is quite a bit of information that you can extrapolate from the data. Here are some examples of questions to ask yourself:\n\n" +
      "<b>Specific to each activity:<b/>\n" +
      "-> What was the end goal of this activity? Were there any lasting results?\n-> What skills or lessons did I learn while participating in this activity?\n-> What roles/responsibilities did I take on which challenged me? How did I grow from them?\n-> What do my accomplishments and awards say about my character?\n\n" +
      "<b>Big Picture Questions:<b/>\n" +
      "-> Do I often pursue leadership roles? If not, why?\n-> Am I committed to any activities or do I bounce from one to another without real investment?\n-> Am I doing things that I am passionate about?\n-> How much of my time is spent productively? (Learning, improving, providing value, helping others)\n\n" +
      "From just a few simple questions, you can reveal a very large amount about who you are and your motivations. If you are unsatisfied with your answers, don’t run, hide, or worry! Once you make the simple decision to improve yourself and once you get the ball rolling, you’ll find how fulfilling it is to be pleased with your answers!\n\n",
    tracker:
      "Since inspiring you to win scholarships is the principal objective of PocketScholar, a scholarship tracker is pretty much a requirement! Using PocketScholar’s Resources page alongside your own research, it should be relatively easy to load the tracker full of scholarships relevant to your interests and circumstances. *None of the following examples are in any way related*\n\n" +
      "<b>Fields:</b>\n" +
      "<i>Name:</i> The name of the scholarship / the organization that provides it (eg: TD Community Leadership)\n\n" +
      "<i>Deadline:</i> The date that submissions are due (eg: March 16th, 2023)\n\n" +
      "<i>Value:</i> The amount of money the scholarship is worth (eg: $10,000,000!)\n\n" +
      "<i>Criteria / Special Requirements:</i> Some scholarships have specific criteria to be eligible to win (eg: specific to engineering students) (eg: must be / be the child of someone employed at [company])\n\n" +
      "<i>Essay Topic:</i> Does this scholarship require an essay or written component? What is it about? (eg: How should countries approach the needs of public health vs. those of individual privacy?)\n\n",
    promptsPage:
      "The Prompts page is likely the most demanding component of PocketScholar, and it has good reason to be. These prompts mimic similar ones on real scholarship applications, asking you to expand upon the conclusions drawn from your activity list and to back up your thoughts with evidence of your growth.\n\n" +
      "It sounds like a tough job, but after completing the Prompts page, you will have already done much of the work required to apply for even the most prestigious of scholarships!\n\n" +
      "It may help to store your fully fleshed out answers elsewhere, but as ideas pop up throughout your day, jot them down immediately under the prompt they relate to so that you can reference them later.\n\n" +
      "Don’t walk away from PocketScholar without being able to thoroughly answer all of the prompts while being genuinely proud of your answers! How much have you grown since picking up PocketScholar? What have you accomplished? What great things are foreshadowed by your successes thus far?\n\n",
    resourcesPage:
      "The Resources page acts as a bridge to link the ideas presented in PocketScholar to other amazing sources of knowledge that reach beyond the scope of the content covered within the app.\n\n" +
      "<b>There you will find:</b>\n\n" +
      "<i>Scholarship Search Engines</i> - you can take a look at scholarships which are up for grabs and learn more about post-secondary education.\n\n" +
      "<i>Book Recommendations</i> -  a collection of some of my favorite reads that have relevant connections to the goals of PocketScholar.\n\n" +
      "<i>Additional Resources</i> - to help you go above and beyond what PocketScholar has to offer and continue your self learning.\n\n" +
      "<i>Sources</i> - my english teacher would be mad at me otherwise.\n\n" +
      "PocketScholar is just the beginning, and there’s so much more to learn! Of course if you still have questions there are certainly other places which will hold the answers you’re looking for. Although if you are ever feeling uncertain or don’t know where to look next, return to PocketScholar and collect your thoughts.\n\n" +
      "I have the utmost faith in you. You can do it!\n\n",
    notes:
      "<b>1)</b> If you’re a student yourself, congratulations! Taking initiative and putting yourself in the position to become a scholar early is an undertaking that too many forgo. Fortunately, you’re not alone. Introduce PocketScholar to your parents, teachers, siblings, friends, and others that could either discuss the content with you and help you along your journey, or benefit from PocketScholar themselves!\n\n" +
      "<b>2)</b> In the case that you’re a parent, relative, teacher, coach, or friend, if you know someone who’s future you could impact by giving them access to PocketScholar, don’t do them a disservice! You have the possibility to positively influence someone’s future by accelerating their journey towards success. There’s no reason not to!\n\n" +
      "<b>3)</b> PocketScholar should keep you coming back. As you grow your Activities List, answer all the Prompts, and fill out the Scholarship Tracker, you should frequently reference the About, Get Started, and Challenges pages. Use the time to reflect on your progress, ensure you’re on the right track, and admire how far you’ve come!\n\n" +
      "<b>4)</b> PocketScholar is not a guide for applying to scholarships, but a guide on how to be an amazing candidate for them. Once you go above and beyond, applications will be a breeze! When it is time to finally start searching (grade 11 recommended) and applying (usually grade 12), you can find many scholarship search engines on the Resources page.\n\n" +
      "<b>5)</b> Some of PocketScholar’s resources are targeted for Canadians. But if you’re not a Canuck, don’t let that dissuade you from the rest of the content! The principles you’ll learn can be applied anywhere on the globe.\n\n",

    whatsAScholarship:
      "Scholarships are free money... aren’t they? While there is a sliver of truth in that common saying, depicting them as ‘free’ can be pretty misleading. Free money implies that there is little to no work to be done to earn it - and that couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\n" +
      "<b>What do you mean?</b>\n\n" +
      "Scholarship money doesn’t just appear out of thin air. Whether it’s an individual, organization, school or another entity, someone else is giving you that money for a reason! They’ve observed something within you that they believe in. It could be extraordinary skills, infectious compassion, or unflinching leadership. Whatever those strengths are, the element that sets a scholar apart is their potential.\n\n" +
      "<b>Potential.</b> This is the reason that the vast majority of donors offer scholarships. They see you following a positive, upward trend, and they provide financial aid to accelerate your growth. A scholarship is an investment in its recipient - the student who demonstrates high potential and is likely to become a prominent individual in the future. By maintaining their momentum, the student is on course to convert their potential into even greater results than they have already realized.\n\n" +
      "<b>Self-Check:</b>\n" +
      "- How might I quantify or define potential?\n\n" +
      "- What do I have the potential to do right now?\n\n" +
      "- What activities might increase my potential?\n\n",

    investInYourself:
      "<i><b>Investment: The act of devoting time, effort, or resources to a particular undertaking with the expectation of a worthwhile, often more valuable result.</b></i>\n\n" +
      "By investing their money (resources) into an individual that exudes potential, scholarship donors are hoping to help you hit the ground running during your transition to an independent life. They would prefer that you focus on performing, innovating or creating rather than worrying about paying off debt. An offer of such overwhelming generosity should not be taken lightly, so now that you have chosen to pursue scholarships, be prepared to act diligently.\n\n" +
      "Donors are putting their confidence into your character and skills, predicting that you will provide value to your community, country, and the world. Unsurprisingly, to gain such confidence, you have to provide evidence that you have the ever-important potential they’re seeking. You need to distinguish yourself from the masses by taking initiative and exceeding expectations. Pushing your limits to create/do/achieve something that few others are willing to - that is the outcome to strive for.\n\n" +
      "<b>Don’t be intimidated!</b> Having evidence of your growth and your potential is the end goal. You are likely to still be a long way away, with an abundance of time at your side. You might be struggling to imagine your own future accomplishments, but that time will come! First you need to build your potential.\n\n" +
      "<i>‘Okay… It’s exciting that I’ll get there someday, but where do I start?’</i>\n\n" +
      "Before others will have the faith to make an investment in you, you need to be consistently investing in yourself first. To put it plainly, you should see each and every day as an opportunity to become better than - or accomplish more than - the person you were yesterday.\n\n" +
      "Accomplishments feel amazing when they finally arrive, but from my experience, the contentment is fleeting. To successfully invest in yourself, you need to ensure that your energy is put to good use, and you need to enjoy the process of self-investment just as much as the outcome.\n\n" +
      "<b>Self-Check:</b>\n" +
      "- Which activities do I partake in, and what achievements have I made that forecast my future success?\n\n" +
      "- Do I actively invest in myself?\n\n" +
      "- What did I do yesterday that I will do better today? (Ask this one daily!)\n\n",
    investmentEquations:
      "Simply telling you to ‘invest in yourself’ seems ambiguous and might cause some dissatisfaction. Instead, I would like to provide some tools for comprehension; they’re equations built to help you visualize the process of investing in yourself.\n\n" +
      "These equations are <i>non-negotiable</i> - if you are missing even one of the ‘ingredients’ you will not get the desired results! On the other hand, if you aren’t getting the results you predicted, you are likely lacking an adequate amount or balance of the ingredients.\n\n" +
      "Maybe they should have been called recipes instead!\n\n" +
      "Whatever way you look at them, these equations should be of use to you when planning to invest in yourself. They’ll then be of further use when analyzing your progress, to see what’s working, what’s not, and they’ll help you decide what changes should be made to fit your needs.\n\n",
    equations1and2:
      "Before getting to the most impactful equation, equation #3, it’s necessary to understand what makes it as important as it is. Equations #1 and #2  will provide that context:\n\n" +
      "<b>Equation #1</b>\n" +
      "<i>Skills + Character + Wisdom = <b>Potential</b><i>\n\n" +
      "If you had trouble defining ‘potential’ on your own, here is my *unofficial* definition. These three components are what form your potential as a person. What you are capable of accomplishing is the sum of the skills and wisdom (knowledge from experiences) you have acquired, along with <i>who you have become</i> as a person. Simple math declares that increasing any one of these three elements increases your overall potential to do big things.\n\n" +
      "<b>Equation #2</b>\n" +
      "<i>Potential + Impact = <b>Achievement</b><i>\n\n" +
      "In the end, potential is ultimately useless if nothing is made of it. To <i>achieve</i> a goal, that <i>potential</i> needs to be put to <i>work</i> in order to make an <i>impact</i>. Winning a competition, hosting a volunteer community event, running a successful company - in each <b>activity</b> someone is using their skills, character, and wisdom to positively influence the lives of people around them.\n\n" +
      "But before doing these sorts of things, those people first built their potential. But, where did they get all the ingredients for potential? Equation #3 has got you covered.\n\n",
    equation3:
      "The last and most important equation is the essence of self-investment:\n\n" +
      "<b>Equation #3</b>\n" +
      "<i>Thought + Effort + Time --> Skills + Character + Wisdom<i>\n\n" +
      "It’s a very general equation, but it wouldn’t be fun if I gave you all the answers!\n\n" +
      "Actively applying the equation will help you find new ways to invest in yourself, and help you get more out of the activities you already do. \n\n" +
      "We can break down the equation to show you how to map out your own self-investment strategy. Later sections will dive deeper to fully explore each element of the equation. As an example, we’ll use “starting a club” as our self-investment activity of choice. Starting or leading a club is a great way to spend your time if you are looking to build many strengths at once.\n\n" +
      "In real life, analyzing your own activities of interest using this equation will help you get a better sense of what you gain from the activities, and whether they are worth your thought, time, and effort. The objective is to determine whether an activity is worthy of being used to invest in yourself.\n\n",
    breakdownIngredients:
      "<i>Thought + Effort + Time --> Skills + Character + Wisdom<i>\n\n" +
      "<b>Example: starting a club<b>\n\n" +
      "<u><b>Thought</b></u>\n" +
      "You might have noticed that there is an arrow instead of an equals sign in the equation. That’s no mistake. It signifies that <b>the equation can only move in one direction.</b> Evidently, once you spend time and effort, there’s no getting it back. That’s why thought is so important! Before moving, you should always make sure you’re about to go in the right direction.\n\n" +
      "<b>When starting a club, your initial thoughts might look like this:</b>\n" +
      "-> What need does this club fulfill / Who does it help?\n-> How many others would be interested and willing to join?\n-> What would club meetings and activities look like?n-> What resources do I need?n-> How should I promote the club?n-> And many more…\n\n" +
      "While thought is important, don't let it be an excuse to procrastinate and not put in the effort. Don’t set and forget your plans either! Habitually review and reassess your actions to align yourself back with your goals.\n\n" +
      "<u><b>Effort</b></u>\n" +
      "Effort is what really gets you places! Now that you have a trajectory, it’s time to give it all you’ve got. Even if your venture is somehow unsuccessful, rest assured that you will have gained valuable abilities by simply doing the work. You have nothing to lose and much to gain!\n\n" +
      "Be sure to challenge yourself from time to time, because a healthy amount of struggle is one of the greatest ways to heighten learning.\n\n" +
      "Forming a club takes quite a bit of effort. Assembling other leaders, planning activities, writing promo material and conducting meetings are just a few of duties you might encounter. Each of these promotes different abilities, and together, supply each type of benefit outlined in equation #3.\n\n" +
      "<b>What you might ask yourself about your effort:</b>\n" +
      "-> Is my club promotional material attractive and informative?\n-> Is the content of my meetings engaging and useful?\n-> Am I leading the meetings with enthusiasm and energy?\n\n" +
      "<u><b>Time</b></u>\n" +
      "What’s the point of all your thinking and effort if it only lasts for hours, days or weeks? Every <i>skill</i> takes time to develop, you can’t alter your <i>personality</i> in an instant, and the more you <i>experience</i>, the more you’ll learn. It might not purely be about how much time you invest either - the consistency at which you invest it matters just as much.\n\n" +
      "Likewise, there is no point in forming a club just to have one meeting!\n\n" +
      "<b>Ask yourself questions like these:</b>\n" +
      "-> Am I spending an adequate amount of time preparing for club meetings?\n-> How frequent should meetings be to create a positive impact on myself and others?\n\n" +
      "Once you have invested the necessary thought, effort, and time into your endeavour, you’re going to start seeing the fruits of your labour. Progress will seem slow and steady at first, but as your list of self-investment activities lengthens, your new abilities will compound and assist you in gaining even more!\n\n",

    breakdownResults:
      "<i>Thought + Effort + Time --> Skills + Character + Wisdom<i>\n\n" +
      "<b>Example: starting a club<b>\n\n" +
      "<u><b>Skills:</b></u>\n" +
      "The work you do in your activity will have a direct correlation to what skills you get out of it. If you have certain skills in mind, you should try to choose an activity which will push you to expand upon those which you would like to develop or improve upon.\n\n" +
      "<b>Important skills you’ll likely develop/improve when starting a club:</b>\n" +
      "-> Leadership and group management\n-> Public Speaking\n->Time Management\n->Creative Thinking\n\n" +
      "<u><b>Character</b></u>\n" +
      "How you conduct yourself, how you treat others, and how you face adversity are equally, if not more important than your specific technical abilities. What character traits have you acquired/improved while engaging in the activity?\n\n" +
      "<b>Improvements to your character that may occur when starting a club:</b>n" +
      "-> ‘Since starting my club, I’ve felt more ,<u>confident</u> to share my ideas with others’\n-> ‘After having a dispute about the topic of the next meeting, I realized that I should become more <u>open-minded</u> to the opinions of others.’ \n->‘After the last meeting’s flop, I did some <u>retrospective thinking</u> and made necessary changes. Everyone loved today’s meeting!’\n\n" +
      "<u><b>Wisdom</b></u>\n" +
      "Despite what people might say, you can have wisdom at any age, so long as you have the experience to back it up. The key is to apply that knowledge in the future. Avoiding past mistakes, preventing new ones, and using the lessons you’ve learned to your advantage will go a long way. Capitalize on the experiences created by investing in yourself!\n\n" +
      "<b>For example, running a club might teach you that:</b>\n" +
      "-> Taking feedback and criticism graciously is very important. You can use it as an opportunity to better yourself and your work.\n-> You can’t please everyone, so just do the best you can. Understanding that not everyone will agree with you or support you is healthy and will eliminate unproductive stress.\n\n" +
      "With the equation fully dissected, you can take it and apply it to any activity of your choosing. If the activity is worthy of being considered self-investment, the results that you see in yourself will be directly proportional to the quality and amount of thought, effort, and time that you put into it!\n\n",
    applyEquation3:
      "You can easily and frequently practice applying Equation #3 by referring back to PocketScholar. Take a look at your <b>Activity List</b> and work each activity into the equation.\n\n" +
      "By scrutinizing <i>each element of the activity</i> (thought, effort, time, skill, character, wisdom), you will learn a lot about what you are putting in, and what you are getting out of it. Determining what activities you consider self-investment should be relatively simple. <b>Ask yourself:</b>\n\n" +

      "Not all activities you partake in need to be considered investing in yourself, after all, life doesn’t boil down to a relentless pursuit of self-improvement. They can have other benefits like enjoyment, socialization, and supporting/helping others. Ideally, the activities you participate in to invest in yourself will have such benefits too!\n\n" +

      "Once again, to successfully invest in yourself, you need to ensure your energy is put to good use, and you need to enjoy the process of self-investment just as much as the outcome.\n\n" +
      "Using investment equation #3, you have the ability to determine which activities are worth pursuing when investing in yourself. You can confidently put your energy where it will benefit you the most.\n\n" +
      "The next thing to decide is which self-investment activities are enjoyable to you. Investing in yourself needs to be sustainable and should be lifelong. Taking pleasure in what you do is the best way to ensure that you’ll continue doing it.\n\n" +
      "When I was younger, I always envisioned that discovering my passion would be some major tipping point in my life. I thought that one day, while doing something ordinary, I would have a moment of intense fulfillment and realize that what I was doing was my true passion. I would treasure my passion, strive for excellence, master it, and live happily ever after. How naive. That moment of realization hasn’t come and I doubt it ever will.\n\n" +
      "It probably won’t come for you either.\n\n" +
      "Fortunately for you and me both, over time I have come to reevaluate what developing a passion means to the average person. A passion is something that inches into your life over a long period of time. You start off with an inkling of interest in a subject, so you test the waters.\n\n" +
      "As months... years pass, you gradually explore the depth of the subject, then before you know it you’ll have formed an intense fascination with what could now be considered your passion!\n\n" +
      "A passion is usually shaped little by little, and will sneak under the radar as it continues to grow within you. You’ll never be sure when you’ll be introduced to one of your passions because many people don’t realize it’s there until it has become a significant part of their life.\n\n" +
      "One thing <i>is</i> for sure though: Your passions will never be handed to you. Despite what my younger self thought, your passions won’t settle into your lap while you stick to your same routines day in and day out. You have to hunt them down like a kindergartener playing hide and seek. Weird analogy... but you’ll just have to hear me out!\n\n" +

    hideAndSeek:
      "Assuming you haven’t already established a passion or two, you’re still in a major exploratory phase of your life. You have a general idea of your interests, your likes and dislikes, but that’s probably the extent of it. You might be overwhelmed with all the possibilities that the world has to offer, or maybe you’re more like I was, that is, oblivious to them. Either way, that has to change.\n\n" +
      "Whether you’re not aware of what's out there, don’t know where to start, or somewhere in between, you’re going to begin searching for what might eventually become passions.\n\n" +
      "Imagine yourself playing an exceptionally long game of hide and seek; you’re the hunter, and your passions are the hunted. You don’t know where they’ll turn up, so you are going to have to scout your entire landscape to determine where to look first. That is, do some research on a few general fields of your choosing. Then select a subfield that looks appealing to you This might be a small interest that you’ve had for a while, or something completely new that catches your attention.\n\n" +
      "Intrigued by art? Try out drawing something that appeals to you, or watch some tutorials on 3D animation! Fascinated by technology? Read about the latest advances in artificial intelligence, or mess around with a DIY circuitry project!\n\n" +
      "Do a preliminary evaluation of the area for a short period of time, at least a couple of weeks. Test run it yourself by doing research, performing activities, or talking to people familiar with the field! Give yourself adequate time to develop some fundamental skills and knowledge, then ask the following: Does anything grab my attention? What stands out to me? How might this interest be simultaneously used to invest in myself?\n\n" +
      "If you feel like continuing your pursuit, take a closer look. Search deep into those activities of interest and continue your efforts to find something that really grips you! You might love making music but dread practicing an instrument. Try downloading a free DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and follow some tutorials to make whatever you want! Over a couple weeks or months, gauge your enthusiasm and determine whether you want to further invest in the field.\n\n" +
      "Then rinse and repeat! Continue to pursue the subjects you enjoy and slowly ease away from the ones that you genuinely dislike. Then begin to branch out and try to build an array of diverse or complementary passions! You’re guaranteed to not enjoy certain topics, and enjoy some more than others, so with this approach comes a lot of trial and error. In doing so however, you get the chance to have a wide range of experiences, and really get to know yourself, your tastes and distastes.\n\n" +
      "This is a process that takes patience and a willingness to try new things. But in the end, taking initiative to discover the things that motivate you will put you in the position to do enjoyable, meaningful work that will allow you to routinely invest in yourself!\n\n" +
      "Hide and seek is ultimately just a game, so try not to take yourself too seriously. Be open to taking risks and taking up opportunities that intimidate you. It sounds scary, but once you start, you’ll start having much more fun and will grow quicker than you thought you ever could!\n\n" +

      "It’s really easy to get comfortable with your present environment and confine yourself to familiar surroundings. It’s one thing to be happy with who you are and what you’re doing today, but a completely different story if you think you’ll be happy cruising in your current state for the rest of your life. That’s called complacency. If you feel it, be cautious because disruption will arrive sooner than you think! Instead of being forced to change because of your situation, be proactive and change your situation for your own sake!\n\n" +
      "I used to use busyness as an excuse to thwart my feelings of complacency. I was ‘always’ busy with commitments that “devoured my time”. In reality, it was entirely possible to find time to suspend my routines and challenge myself in ways I hadn’t before.\n\n" +
      "I hesitated to put myself in uncomfortable situations that I might have not known how to handle, to talk to new people who seemed to share nothing in common, or to do complex things with no idea where to start. Because of this, I have undoubtedly passed up chances to meet amazing new people, to learn and grow, and to share novel experiences with others.\n\n" +
      "Reflect on how often you break the boundaries of your comfort. When was the last time you made yourself uncomfortable on purpose? Warm up with daily baby steps like striking up a short 1-2 minute conversation with a stranger at school, work or someone you otherwise rarely talk to. If you're impatient, you could throw yourself into the flames instead.\n\n" +
      "I was petrified the first time I spoke in front of hundreds of people. Quaking in my size 5 dress shoes, my stone cold figure took the stage. It was far from perfect, but the speech lifted a monstrous weight of anxiety off my shoulders and replaced it with a healthy amount of confidence that would stay with me to this day.

      "Your passion is unlikely to be discovered in a single moment of enlightenment. Rather, it is slowly developed over time, which demands more work, but will contribute to a much greater payoff in the long run.\n\n" +
      "Take initiative to identify what interests you, then pursue it. Don’t stop the moment you encounter difficulty or boredom, persevere until you fully grasp what it has to offer. Only then will you be equipped to decide whether to continue or discard the endeavour.\n\n" +
      "Enjoy yourself every step of the way, but never get comfortable by keeping yourself constrained to the familiar. Make yourself uncomfortable by starting off slow or doing something terrifying.\n\n" +
